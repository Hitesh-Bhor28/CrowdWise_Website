            <li>
                <strong>Live Crowd Heatmap:</strong> A real-time, interactive map visualizing crowd density and hotspots. Integrated with Leaflet for robust performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Crowd Video Analysis:</strong> Upload CCTV footage or provide a video URL to get real-time people counts and density estimates. Features an auto-analysis mode for continuous monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Predictive Alerts:</strong> An AI model analyzes historical and real-time data to generate predictive alerts for high-congestion events before they become critical.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Evacuation Route Suggestion:</strong> In emergencies, the AI suggests the safest and fastest evacuation routes, which are then rendered directly on the map, avoiding congested paths.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Incident Reporting:</strong> Automatically generate detailed incident reports from alerts with a single click, including summaries, priority levels, and suggested actions.
